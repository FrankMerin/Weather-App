# Weather-App
Current Weather App

This is a weather app that I built while watching a tutorial on youtube since I wanted to learn how utalize a GUI interface with python. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8-snVfekto

I made some adjustments to the original as well since the original did not respond to the enter key in place of the button. I also added the temporary text within the entry feild. I intend to make some additional changes, including having the background change to the state flag of the location entered.
